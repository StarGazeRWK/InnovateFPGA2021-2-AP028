## AP028 - Development of Intelligent Food Supply Chain Management System

This project proposal presents an Intelligent Food Supply Chain Management System for covering from field to end-user. This project is based principally on THREE (3) different application areas such as Food Plantation, Food Warehouse, and Food Transportation using a smart intelligent system. This system seeks to support and to reduce food waste by improving the reliability of the technology from manual detection to automated detection system designed especially for real-time monitoring using IoT implementation on growth and maturity level of fruits in the Food Plantation, classification of fruits grading in the Food Warehouse and also fruits controlling and tracking during Food Transportation operation. The system is implemented on a FPGA-SoC Intel Cyclone V SoC available on DE10-Nano Kit, Microsoft Azure, and Analogue Devices module to acquire the sensors reading and control the actuators to maintain the suitable environment in three different application areas. The proposed system has high-performance requirements covered by FPGA-SoC since it has concurrency and low power consumption, making it suitable for this intelligent food supply chain management system in smart agriculture applications.
